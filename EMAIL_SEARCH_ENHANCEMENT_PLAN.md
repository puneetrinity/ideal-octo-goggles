Email Search Enhancement Plan for Ultra Fast Search System

CURRENT STATUS: The system can handle 1GB+ datasets but needs email-specific enhancements

REQUIRED MODIFICATIONS:

1. EMAIL DATA STRUCTURE ENHANCEMENT:
   - Add email-specific metadata fields (sender, recipient, date, subject)
   - Modify document structure to handle email headers
   - Add email parsing capabilities

2. SEARCH FILTER ENHANCEMENT:
   - Add sender/recipient filters
   - Add date range filters  
   - Add email type filters (sent/received/cc/bcc)

3. QUERY PROCESSING ENHANCEMENT:
   - Add person name normalization
   - Add email address extraction
   - Add fuzzy name matching

IMPLEMENTATION EXAMPLE:

# Enhanced Email Document Structure:
{
    "id": "email_123",
    "content": "Email body text...",
    "metadata": {
        "sender": "john.doe@company.com",
        "sender_name": "John Doe", 
        "recipients": ["jane@company.com"],
        "subject": "Project Update",
        "date": "2025-07-02T10:30:00Z",
        "email_type": "sent"
    }
}

# Enhanced Search Query:
POST /api/v2/search/ultra-fast
{
    "query": "project update meeting",
    "filters": {
        "sender_name": "John Doe",
        "date_range": {
            "start": "2025-01-01",
            "end": "2025-07-02"
        }
    }
}

PERFORMANCE EXPECTATIONS FOR 1GB EMAIL DATA:
- ~500K-1M emails (depending on average size)
- Search response time: 50-200ms 
- Memory usage: 2-4GB (with PQ compression)
- Index build time: 10-30 minutes (one-time)

SEARCH ACCURACY:
- Semantic search: High (finds emails by content meaning)
- Person search: High (with proper filtering)
- Mixed queries: Very High (hybrid approach)
